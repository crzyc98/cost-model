You absolutely can—and in fact benefit greatly—by building a lightweight web‐based “control panel” for your projection engine. Here’s how one might structure it:

1. Web UI for Scenario Management

Offer CRUD screens for your configs/ scenarios so analysts can add, edit, or delete YAML definitions without touching the file system.
	•	Frontend Framework: Use React for component‐based UIs—its ecosystem has mature admin‐panel patterns (e.g. Tailwind-powered dashboards) that let you scaffold tables, forms, and modals quickly  ￼.
	•	Styling: Tailwind CSS (or shadcn/ui on top of it) gives you utility classes for responsive layouts, form controls, and cards  ￼.
	•	Forms & Validation: Integrate React Hook Form or Formik for binding YAML fields to JSON, with instant client-side validation.

2. Backend API & Job Orchestration

Provide a REST (or GraphQL) API for scenario CRUD and “run” actions:
	•	Web Framework: FastAPI offers built-in type hints, automatic OpenAPI docs, and async support for high throughput  ￼. Alternatively, Flask is a minimal micro-framework that’s very familiar to many teams  ￼.
	•	Task Queue: Use Celery to dispatch long-running projections into background workers, with Flower for real-time job monitoring and control  ￼.
	•	Database: Persist scenario metadata and run histories in Postgres (or SQLite for small teams), and store logs in a centralized store like Elasticsearch.

3. Real-Time Logging & Monitoring Dashboard

Stream your Python logs and run-status updates into a log aggregator and visualize live metrics:
	•	Grafana + Loki: Push structured logs from your engine to Grafana Loki, then build Grafana dashboards showing throughput, errors, and key KPIs  ￼.
	•	Kibana + Elasticsearch: Index logs into Elasticsearch and use Kibana for full-text search, dashboards, alerting, and anomaly detection  ￼.
	•	Plotly Dash: For custom in-browser charts (e.g. headcount over time), embed a Dash app directly in your UI  ￼.

4. Putting It All Together
	1.	Analyst UI: React SPA with pages for Scenarios (list/detail), Runs (live status), and Logs (searchable view).
	2.	API Layer: FastAPI services with endpoints like POST /scenarios, PUT /scenarios/{id}, and POST /runs that enqueue a Celery job.
	3.	Worker Layer: Celery workers execute project_census, emit structured JSON logs, and update run-status in the database.
	4.	Monitoring: Flower for Celery task health, Grafana/Loki or Kibana for log dashboards, and built-in counters (e.g. processed rows, errors) surfaced via Prometheus (or directly in your logs).

Example Tech-Stack References
	•	React + Tailwind: See “Admin One React Tailwind” templates for CRUD tables, modals, forms  ￼.
	•	FastAPI: Type-safe, async, with auto-docs at /docs  ￼.
	•	Celery + Flower: Dispatch & monitor background tasks with real-time UI  ￼.
	•	Grafana Loki: Centralize logs, run queries, set alerts  ￼.
	•	Kibana: Rich log exploration and dashboarding  ￼.
	•	Plotly Dash: Embed performant, interactive plots in your Python stack  ￼.
	•	Flask (alternative): Minimal micro-framework for those preferring WSGI  ￼.

5. Next Steps
	1.	Prototype just the Scenario CRUD in React + FastAPI.
	2.	Wire up a “Run Now” button that enqueues a Celery job and shows status via WebSocket or polling.
	3.	Push logs to Loki/Kibana and build a sample dashboard (e.g. run latencies, error rates).
	4.	Iterate: Add authentication, RBAC, custom triggers, and alerts.

With this architecture, your analysts get a friendly UI to manage scenarios, kick off projections, and watch real-time progress and outcomes—all powered by the robust logging and rule-engine you’ve already built.
