## Coding Standards
1. **Type Hints**: Use Python type hints consistently
2. **Logging**: Use the configured logging system instead of print statements
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling with meaningful messages
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear docstrings and comments
5. **Testing**: Ensure new code has corresponding tests in the `tests/` directory

## Key Conventions
1. **Snapshot Management**:
   - Use `snapshot.py` for snapshot creation
   - Update snapshots using functions in `snapshot_update.py`
   - Maintain data consistency with schema definitions in `schema.py`
   - Ensure all snapshots contain valid compensation data for all employees
   - Log any compensation validation issues with appropriate severity levels

2. **Compensation Handling**:
   - All employees must have valid compensation values
   - Default to role-based compensation when specific data is missing
   - Log all compensation assignments and validations
   - Handle pandas NA/NaN values appropriately in all compensation calculations
   - Document any compensation-related assumptions or fallbacks

3. **Event Logging**:
   - Log all significant state changes
   - Use structured logging for better querying
   - Include relevant context in log messages, especially for compensation events
   - Log warnings when default values are used for missing compensation data

3. **Configuration**:
   - Store configuration in YAML files under `config/`
   - Avoid hardcoding parameters in the code
   - Use configuration namespaces for different environments

4. **Performance**:
   - Optimize for large datasets
   - Use vectorized operations with pandas/numpy
   - Be mindful of memory usage with large snapshots

## Common Tasks
1. **Adding New Features**:
   - Follow the existing project structure
   - Add appropriate type hints and docstrings
   - Include unit tests
   - Update documentation

2. **Debugging**:
   - Check logs in `output_dev/projection_logs/`
   - Use structured logging for better traceability
   - Validate data against schema definitions

   - Keep README files up to date

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Compensation Validation**:
   - Missing compensation values in new hires or promotions
   - Inconsistent handling of NA/NaN values in compensation calculations
   - Forgetting to validate compensation after major state changes

2. **Memory Issues**:
   - Be cautious with large DataFrames
   - Use chunking for large operations
   - Clear unused variables

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**:
   - Avoid loops over DataFrame rows
   - Use vectorized operations
   - Profile code to identify slow sections

3. **Data Consistency**:
   - Validate data after transformations
   - Check for index uniqueness
   - Handle edge cases

   - Include relevant context in log messages
   - Log at appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

4. **Code Quality**
   - Follow PEP 8 style guide
   - Use type hints consistently
   - Write meaningful docstrings and comments

5. **Testing**
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Run tests before submitting changes

## Getting Help
1. Check the project documentation
2. Review existing code for similar patterns
3. Use the logging system to trace issues
4. Consult the project's issue tracker for known problems

To have a robust, fully functional, and accurate workforce cost simulation model capable of:
	•	Running deterministic and stochastic workforce projections over multiple years.
	•	Accurately modeling hiring, terminations (experienced and new-hire), promotions, compensation adjustments, and other workforce-related events.
	•	Producing clear, structured, and accurate data snapshots and comprehensive event logs.
	•	Ensuring consistency, accuracy, and transparency across all modules and code, with rigorous validation and zero tolerance for bugs or inaccuracies.
	•	Clearly documented and easily maintainable codebase with automated logging and tracking mechanisms.

⸻

Current Project Focus:

Ensuring deterministic and stochastic termination logic works correctly for both experienced employees and new hires, specifically addressing issues related to decreasing termination rates over simulation years and lack of new hire terminations. This includes debugging the snapshot and event log orchestration modules to maintain accurate annual workforce summaries.
