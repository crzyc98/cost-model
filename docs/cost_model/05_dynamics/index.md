## Promotion Matrix Loading & Defaults

Promotion transitions are controlled by a Markov matrix loaded from the scenario config:

```yaml
# dev.yaml
promotion_matrix_path: ~    # null â†’ use built-in default
# prod.yaml
promotion_matrix_path: config/promotion_matrix_prod.yaml
```

In Python, use:
```python
from cost_model.state.job_levels.sampling import load_markov_matrix
matrix = load_markov_matrix(path, allow_default=True)  # logs INFO to 'warnings_errors' logger if default is used
```
If the path is `None` and `allow_default=True`, a default 3x3 identity matrix is used and an INFO log is emitted (logger: 'warnings_errors'). If the file is missing or invalid, the system logs an error and exits.
