# Workforce Simulation & Cost Model Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Workforce Simulation & Cost Model project. This documentation is designed to help you understand, use, and contribute to the codebase effectively.

## System Overview

The Workforce Simulation & Cost Model is a sophisticated system designed to model employee lifecycle events, project workforce costs, and analyze the financial impact of HR policies over time. It provides valuable insights for strategic workforce planning and retirement benefit analysis.
