Here’s a high‑level summary of smart additions, an updated README incorporating them, and clear implementation steps.

Summary

To align your model with real‑world HR analytics, it’s smart to:
	•	Calibrate hiring by explicitly accounting for differing attrition among new hires vs. experienced staff.
	•	Embed cohort analysis, tracking turnover by tenure group.
	•	Leverage survival analysis (e.g. Kaplan–Meier) for richer hazard estimates.
	•	Classify agents into four end‑of‑year categories for clearer reporting.
	•	Estimate parameters from historical data via hazard modeling (Cox, Weibull).
	•	Optionally simulate monthly transitions for smoother dynamics.
	•	Surface onboarding best practices to initialize new‑hire behavior.
	•	Visualize survival curves to validate your assumptions.

Below is an updated README.md with these enhancements, followed by a phased implementation guide.

Feedback & Proposed Additions
	1.	Implement Calibrated Growth Formula
Replace your simple add‑on hires = Δₜ + Tₜ with

delta = round(N_t * g)
hires = int((delta + h_ex * N_t) / (1 - h_nh))

to guarantee net growth despite higher new‑hire churn  ￼ ￼.

	2.	Embed Cohort Analysis
Add documentation on splitting employees into tenure cohorts (e.g. 0–1 yr, 1–3 yr, 3+ yr) to reveal differentiated turnover patterns  ￼ ￼.
	3.	Leverage Kaplan–Meier Survival Modeling
Introduce a section on using the Kaplan–Meier estimator (via Python’s lifelines) to derive time‑to‑separation curves, handling right‑censoring  ￼ ￼.
	4.	Define Four End‑of‑Year Agent Categories
Clearly document: Continuous Active, Experienced Terminated, New‑Hire Active, New‑Hire Terminated—enabling targeted analysis  ￼.
	5.	Parameter Estimation & Hazard Modeling
Suggest calibrating h_ex and h_nh from your data using econometric hazard models (e.g., Cox or Weibull as in recent turnover studies)  ￼.
	6.	Optional Monthly Transition Simulation
For finer granularity, convert annual rates to monthly:

p_month = 1 - (1 - p_annual) ** (1/12)

smoothing headcount dynamics  ￼.

	7.	Incorporate Onboarding Best Practices
Document that new hires should simulate an initial “engagement curve”—e.g., lower early productivity or elevated early‑tenure hazard—to mirror real onboarding effects  ￼.
	8.	Visualize Survival Curves
Recommend adding sample plots of Kaplan–Meier curves in Jupyter as a sanity check on your hazard assumptions  ￼.
	9.	Add an Implementation Guide Section
Outline your phased rollout plan (below) so contributors can follow a clear roadmap  ￼.
	10.	Document Configuration Parameters
Extend config.yaml docs with descriptions for h_ex, h_nh, and optional monthly_transition flags  ￼.

Updated README.md

# Retirement Plan Cost Model

An agent-based simulation model built with Mesa to estimate plan participation, contributions, and overall cost over multiple years.

---

## Features

- **Agent-Based Modeling**: Simulate individual employee behaviors.
- **Configurable Plan Rules**: Eligibility, auto-enrollment/increase via `config.yaml`.
- **Population Dynamics**: New hires, terminations, and calibrated growth.
- **Precise Financials**: Calculations with Python’s `Decimal`.
- **Rich Output**: Model- and agent-level CSV/Excel results.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repo_url> cost-model
cd cost-model
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt



⸻

Configuration

Edit config.yaml to adjust:
	•	Simulation Years: start_year, projection_length
	•	Attrition Rates:
	•	h_ex: annual experienced attrition rate
	•	h_nh: annual new‑hire attrition rate
	•	Growth Rate: g
	•	Monthly Transitions: monthly_transition: true/false
	•	Onboarding Parameters: initial hazard modifiers, productivity curves

⸻

Data

Place the initial census in census_data.csv with columns:
	•	employee_id, birth_date, start_date, salary, etc.

⸻

Usage

python scripts/run_retirement_plan_abm.py \
  --config config.yaml \
  --census census_data.csv \
  --output results/

Outputs:
	•	results/model_results.csv
	•	results/agent_results.csv

Enhancements to Turnover Modeling

1. Calibrated Hiring Formula

Ensure net growth despite new-hire churn:

delta = round(N_t * g)
hires = int((delta + h_ex * N_t) / (1 - h_nh))

2. Cohort Analysis & Survival Modeling
	•	Cohorts: Segment by tenure buckets (e.g., 0–1 yr, 1–3 yr, 3+ yr).
	•	Survival Analysis: Use Kaplan–Meier (lifelines) to estimate time‑to‑separation curves.

3. Agent Classification Categories

At end of each year classify agents into:
	1.	Continuous Active
	2.	Experienced Terminated
	3.	New‑Hire Active
	4.	New‑Hire Terminated

4. Parameter Estimation & Hazard Modeling

Calibrate h_ex, h_nh via Cox or Weibull hazard models on historical data.

5. Optional Monthly Transition Simulation

Convert annual rates to monthly:

p_month = 1 - (1 - p_annual) ** (1/12)

6. Onboarding Dynamics

Model an initial “engagement curve” for new hires to reflect ramp-up and elevated early churn.

7. Visualization

Include Jupyter notebooks with Kaplan–Meier plots for each cohort to validate assumptions.

Implementation Guide

Phase 1: Calibrated Formula
	1.	Update growth module to compute hires using the calibrated formula.
	2.	Add h_ex, h_nh parameters to config.yaml docs.

Phase 2: Cohorts & Classification
	1.	Extend the agent tracking to record tenure and cohort.
	2.	Implement end‑of‑year classification into four categories.
	3.	Update output CSVs to include category column.

Phase 3: Survival & Hazard Modeling
	1.	Add a preprocessing script to fit Kaplan–Meier and Cox models on historical data.
	2.	Populate config.yaml with estimated hazard parameters.
	3.	Optionally enable monthly transitions via a monthly_transition flag.

Phase 4: Onboarding & Visualization
	1.	Introduce onboarding parameters for early‑tenure productivity and hazard.
	2.	Create example Jupyter notebook to plot survival curves by cohort.
	3.	Document best practices in a new docs/ folder.

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Implement calibrated hiring in `retirement_model.py` and update `config.yaml`.  
2. **Phase 2**: Add cohort bins and classification logic; extend CSV exports.  
3. **Phase 3**: Build a script to estimate hazard rates via `lifelines` and update parameters.  
4. **Phase 4**: Incorporate onboarding curves and create survival‑curve notebook in `docs/`.
