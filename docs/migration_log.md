# Migration Log: Hiring and Termination Flow Refactoring

## Overview
This document tracks the migration of the hiring and termination flow to a new, more modular architecture. The goal was to improve maintainability, testability, and clarity of the simulation logic.

## Key Achievements

### 1. New Modular Architecture
- **Orchestrator Pattern**: Implemented a clear, step-by-step orchestrator in `cost_model/engines/run_one_year/orchestrator.py`
- **Separation of Concerns**: Split logic into focused modules:
  - `markov_promotion.py`: Handles promotions and raises
  - `nh_termination.py`: Manages new-hire terminations
  - `term.py`: Handles experienced employee terminations

### 2. Core Logic Migrated
- **Markov Promotions**: Moved and enhanced promotion logic with better type hints and logging
- **Hazard-Based Terminations**: Integrated existing termination logic with new event-based system
- **New Hire Processing**: Implemented deterministic new-hire terminations with proper event generation
- **Event Aggregation**: Added comprehensive event collection and logging

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- **Type Hints**: Added throughout for better IDE support and code clarity
- **Logging**: Enhanced with consistent formatting and detail levels
- **Documentation**: Added docstrings and module-level documentation
- **Linting**: Fixed all linting issues in the new code

### 4. Legacy Code Cleanup
- **Archived** legacy orchestrator to `cost_model/projections/archive/legacy_runner/`
- **Removed** duplicate code and consolidated logic
- **Documented** all changes in this log and `archived_files.md`

## Technical Insights

### Codebase Structure
- **Configuration**: Uses YAML files with a hierarchical structure, loaded into a namespace
- **Event System**: Central to the simulation, with clear event types and handling
- **State Management**: Clear separation between immutable events and mutable state

### Key Learnings
1. **Event Sourcing**: The codebase effectively uses event sourcing for maintaining state
2. **Configuration First**: New features should be configurable via YAML when possible
3. **Immutability**: The pattern of creating new state rather than mutating existing state is used throughout
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging is crucial for debugging complex simulations

## Migration Steps Completed

### 2025-05-23: CLI and Runner Wiring Review
- Confirmed clean integration with existing CLI and runner
- Verified all necessary configuration is passed through
- Documented configuration requirements

### 2025-05-23: Archived Legacy Orchestrator
- Safely archived old implementation
- Added deprecation warnings
- Created archival documentation

## Next Steps
1. **Test Coverage**: Review and enhance test coverage for the new flow
2. **Performance Testing**: Profile the new implementation
3. **Documentation**: Update any user-facing documentation
4. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring for key metrics in production

## Open Questions
- Are there any performance-critical paths that need optimization?
- Should we add more detailed metrics collection?
- Are there any remaining edge cases in the termination logic?

## Conclusion
The migration to the new hiring and termination flow has been successfully completed. The new implementation is more maintainable, better documented, and follows established patterns in the codebase. The modular design will make it easier to extend or modify the simulation logic in the future.
