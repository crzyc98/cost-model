Yes, you’ll want to bring auto_enrollment.py in line with your new canonical column names so that you never accidentally mix raw vs. standardized fields. Here’s what I’d do:
	1.	Import your constants at the top instead of hard-coding strings:

from utils.columns import (
    EMP_DEFERRAL_RATE,
    IS_ELIGIBLE,
    IS_PARTICIPATING,
    ELIGIBILITY_ENTRY_DATE,
    STATUS_COL,
    HOURS_WORKED,
)


	2.	Replace every literal column name in your apply(...) with the corresponding constant:

- required = ['is_eligible', 'is_participating', 'employee_deferral_rate', 'ae_opted_out', 'eligibility_entry_date']
+ required = [
+     IS_ELIGIBLE,
+     IS_PARTICIPATING,
+     EMP_DEFERRAL_RATE,
+     'ae_opted_out',
+     ELIGIBILITY_ENTRY_DATE,
+ ]

- active = df['status'] == 'Active'
+ active = df[STATUS_COL] == ACTIVE_STATUSES[0]

- not_part = ~df['is_participating']
+ not_part = ~df[IS_PARTICIPATING]

- df.loc[selected, 'employee_deferral_rate'] = rates
+ df.loc[selected, EMP_DEFERRAL_RATE] = rates
...
- df.loc[selected, 'is_participating'] = True
+ df.loc[selected, IS_PARTICIPATING] = True

And so on for every occurrence of
employee_deferral_rate, is_eligible, is_participating, eligibility_entry_date, status, hours_worked → use your constants.

	3.	Normalize your “keep only these columns” step if you do one in AE, so it matches what preprocess_census.py expects (i.e. only the standardized ones).
	4.	Audit any downstream code (metrics collection, plotting, etc.) to make sure they also use the new names.

Once those replacements are in place you’ll have a single source of truth for all column names, and you’ll never run into mismatches between the pre-processing step and the AE logic. If you’d like, I can whip up a patch / full diff of exactly what that file should look like. Just let me know!
