Overall this looks quite solid—your DataFrame‐based apply() and single‐agent agent_is_eligible() now share the same age/tenure/status/hours logic, and your fallback defaults are clear. A few tweaks I’d recommend to make it cleaner, more DRY, and fully “constants‐first”:
	1.	Pull your default fallbacks out to one place
Right now you’re hard‐coding 21 and 12 in two spots. You could define at module top:

DEFAULT_MIN_AGE           = 21
DEFAULT_SERVICE_MONTHS    = 0    # match your YAML default

and then:

min_age            = eligibility_config.get("min_age", DEFAULT_MIN_AGE)
min_service_months = eligibility_config.get("min_service_months", DEFAULT_SERVICE_MONTHS)

That way any future tweaks only touch one constant.

	2.	Use your standardized column names (and constants) instead of literals
Replace every occurrence of "employee_birth_date", "employee_hire_date", "status", etc. with the names from utils.columns (e.g. EMP_BIRTH_DATE, EMP_HIRE_DATE, STATUS_COL if you have one). This guarantees consistency between your preprocess, projection, and rule modules.
	3.	Leverage calculate_tenure for service rather than manual DateOffset
You already import calculate_tenure at the top. In apply(), instead of:

service_met = df['employee_hire_date'] + pd.DateOffset(months=min_service_months)
eligible_by_service = service_met <= sim_end_date

you could vectorize:

df['tenure_months'] = calculate_tenure(df[EMP_HIRE_DATE], simulation_year_end_date) * 12
meets_service = df['tenure_months'] >= min_service_months

Then you don’t need all the fillna(pd.Timestamp.min) dance.

	4.	Move your assign_employment_status import to the module top
It’s unusual to import inside the function unless you’re avoiding a circular import. If you can, just do:

from utils.data_processing import assign_employment_status

at the top of the file.

	5.	Tighten up your is_eligible() wrapper
	•	Use the same column names/keys as you do everywhere else.
	•	If you expect a pandas Series you can accept row: pd.Series instead of bare row.
	•	Honor your DEFAULTS fallback.
	6.	Drop unused or intermediate columns
After you finish determining eligibility, you probably don’t need to leave current_age hanging around unless you explicitly want it in every downstream snapshot. If it’s purely internal, drop it at the end.
	7.	Docstrings & type hints
	•	Move your triple‐quoted docstring for apply() to immediately follow the def apply(...) line.
	•	Add return‐type hints:

def apply(...) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """..."""



With those changes you’ll have a single, fully‐parameterized eligibility engine that’s totally driven by your YAML defaults and constants, with no hidden literals left over.
