in my new hire and auto enroll scenarios that have automatic increase enabled i see that people now have AI Enrolled = True but when i look across the project years for a common individual with that flag their deferral rate is not escalated from where they are 1% per year to the cap set in the scenario run.  the scenario i'm running should bring people from where they are up 1% to the 6% cap i have set.
