o, the last two responses did not find anything directly actionable to fix the "Experienced Terminated" issue. Here’s a clear breakdown:

What Was Found in the Last Two Responses
Codebase Search Results:
Located the filter_prior_terminated function and confirmed it excludes employees terminated before the simulation year.
Identified where employment status assignment and snapshot updates happen.
No new code was edited, and no new hypotheses were confirmed or rejected.
No New Diagnosis:
The responses did not surface a new root cause or a concrete next step for fixing the experienced termination counts.
No evidence was found that directly explains why counts are correct for 2025 but zero for later years.
What Is Still Needed
A step-by-step trace of how terminations propagate through the event log, snapshot update, and employment status assignment for years after 2025.
Verification that the correct employees are included/excluded in each year’s snapshot and summary.
Inspection of whether the logic in assign_employment_status or filter_prior_terminated is too restrictive, or if the event log is missing/incorrect for later years.
Summary:
The previous research steps provided context but did not yield a fix or direct insight. The next step should be a focused trace of a single employee (or a small cohort) through the pipeline for multiple years, or a targeted review of the code paths that affect experienced terminations after the first year.

Would you like me to proceed with a specific trace or review a particular function in detail to move us toward a fix?

Here’s my step-by-step plan for tracing an “Experienced Terminated” employee through the projection pipeline across multiple years. I’ll document each step, what I’m looking for, and what I find:

1. Trace Overview:
Goal: Find out why “Experienced Terminated” counts are correct in 2025 but zero in 2026+.

Key Steps in the Pipeline:
Event Log Creation: Employee gets a termination event in 2025.
Snapshot Update: Termination is applied to the snapshot for 2025 and carried forward.
Employment Status Assignment: In each year, assign status (e.g., “Experienced Terminated”) based on hire/term dates and active flag.
Filtering: filter_prior_terminated removes employees terminated before the current year.
Summary Generation: Summaries count “Experienced Terminated” employees.
2. Step-by-Step Trace
A. Event Log
What I’m Checking: Is the termination event present for the employee in 2025? Does it persist in the event log for later years?
Action: Confirm the event log structure and event filtering.
B. Snapshot Update
What I’m Checking: Does the terminated employee remain in the snapshot for 2026+ with the correct termination date and active=False?
Action: Review _apply_existing_updates and how snapshots are rolled forward.
C. Employment Status Assignment
What I’m Checking: Does assign_employment_status assign “Experienced Terminated” for this employee in 2026+?
Action: Inspect the logic for how status is assigned when hire year < sim_year and term year == sim_year or term year < sim_year.
D. Filtering
What I’m Checking: Does filter_prior_terminated remove this employee from the snapshot in 2026+?
Action: Review the mask: df['active'] | (df['term_year'] == sim_year). If term_year < sim_year, employee is dropped.
E. Summary Generation
What I’m Checking: Are only employees present in the filtered snapshot counted in the employment status summary?
Action: Confirm that “Experienced Terminated” only includes rows that make it through the filter.
3. Initial Diagnosis (Based on Code Review So Far)
Root Cause Likely:
The filter in filter_prior_terminated:
python
CopyInsert
mask = df['active'] | (df['term_year'] == sim_year)
This keeps:
Active employees (not terminated)
Employees terminated in the current year
But:
For years after 2025, employees terminated in 2025 have term_year == 2025 < sim_year, so they are dropped from the snapshot and not counted as “Experienced Terminated” in 2026+.
4. Proposed Fix
Solution:
If you want to count “Experienced Terminated” employees in years after their termination (e.g., for reporting or longitudinal analysis), you need to either:
Not drop them in filter_prior_terminated (i.e., keep them for summary purposes), OR
Generate the “Experienced Terminated” count before filtering, OR
Adjust the filter to optionally retain prior year terminations for summary purposes.
5. Next Steps
I recommend editing filter_prior_terminated or the summary logic to allow tracking of prior year terminations for reporting, without polluting the active/inactive employee pool for other calculations.
Would you like me to propose a concrete code change for this, or do you want to review this diagnosis first?
