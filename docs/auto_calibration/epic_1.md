# Epic 1: Finalize and Verify Age Sensitivity Features

## Status Overview
- ‚úÖ **Age Infrastructure**: Complete (schema.py, age.py, apply_age integration)
- ‚úÖ **Termination Age Sensitivity**: Implemented, functional, and verified
- ‚úÖ **Age Data in Snapshots**: Available in both simulation pathways
- ‚úÖ **Termination Verification**: Complete with comprehensive testing
- ‚ùå **Promotion Age Sensitivity**: Configuration exists but implementation missing
- ‚è≥ **Promotion Verification**: Blocked pending implementation

## User Stories

### User Story 1.1 (Implement Promotion Age Sensitivity) - **IN PROGRESS**
**Status**: üî¥ **BLOCKED** - Implementation needed

As a Model Developer, I want to implement age-based multipliers in the promotion engine, leveraging the existing age.py and schema.py infrastructure, so that promotion probabilities can be realistically influenced by employee age.

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Age multipliers configured in `config/hazard_defaults.yaml` and tuned configs
- ‚úÖ Age data available in snapshots via recent integration work
- ‚ùå No `_apply_age_multipliers` equivalent in promotion engines
- ‚ùå Promotion engines don't use age data for rate adjustments

**Implementation Needed**:
- Add age multiplier logic to promotion engines (similar to `term.py`)
- Integrate with existing hazard configuration loading
- Apply age-based adjustments to promotion rates

### User Story 1.2 (Configure Promotion Age Multipliers) - **COMPLETE**
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DONE**

As a Model Developer, I want to ensure that promotion age multipliers are configurable through the main scenario YAML (similar to how termination multipliers might be) so that they can be included in the auto-tuner's SEARCH_SPACE.

**Evidence**:
- ‚úÖ `promotion.age_multipliers` configured in hazard_defaults.yaml
- ‚úÖ Age multipliers present in tuned configuration files
- ‚úÖ Configuration structure matches termination pattern

### User Story 1.3 (Verify Termination Age Sensitivity - Directional Impact) - **COMPLETE**
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DONE**

As a Model Developer, I want to execute targeted simulation runs with specifically crafted termination age multiplier configurations (Baseline, High Early Attrition, High Late Attrition) so that I can confirm the age sensitivity logic in term.py produces the expected directional changes in termination rates and age distributions.

**Completed Work**:
- ‚úÖ Created test configurations: `hazard_baseline_test.yaml`, `hazard_high_early_attrition_test.yaml`, `hazard_high_late_attrition_test.yaml`
- ‚úÖ Implemented environment variable override mechanism in `_load_hazard_defaults()`
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive test script: `scripts/test_age_sensitivity.py`
- ‚úÖ Executed all three test scenarios successfully
- ‚úÖ Analyzed results and verified age multiplier functionality

**Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ **Age multipliers are working correctly**: Termination rates vary by scenario (Baseline: 17.9%, High Early: 21.6%, High Late: 20.7%)
- ‚úÖ **Age data integration is successful**: All snapshots contain proper age and age band information
- ‚úÖ **Workforce composition changes as expected**: Age multipliers produce measurable effects on workforce demographics
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure is robust**: Environment variable override mechanism works reliably

**Evidence**:
- Test results show clear differentiation between scenarios
- Age calculations are consistent and accurate across all simulation years
- Termination patterns reflect configured age multipliers

### User Story 1.4 (Verify Promotion Age Sensitivity - Directional Impact) - **BLOCKED**
**Status**: üî¥ **BLOCKED** - Depends on User Story 1.1

As a Model Developer, I want to execute targeted simulation runs with specifically crafted promotion age multiplier configurations (once implemented) so that I can confirm the age sensitivity logic in the promotion engine produces the expected directional changes in promotion rates and age distributions.

**Dependencies**:
- ‚ùå Requires completion of User Story 1.1 (promotion age sensitivity implementation)

## Critical Path
1. **Immediate Priority**: Complete User Story 1.1 (Promotion Age Sensitivity Implementation)
2. **Verification Phase**: Execute User Story 1.4 (promotion verification)
3. **Integration**: Ensure both termination and promotion age sensitivity work together

## Recent Achievements
- ‚úÖ **Termination Age Sensitivity Verification**: Comprehensive testing confirms age multipliers work correctly
- ‚úÖ **Test Infrastructure**: Created robust testing framework with environment variable overrides
- ‚úÖ **Age Integration in Projection CLI**: Completed integration ensuring age data is available in both simulation workflows
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Age Calculations**: All yearly snapshots now include proper age and age band data
- ‚úÖ **Evidence-Based Validation**: Demonstrated measurable impact of age multipliers on termination rates
