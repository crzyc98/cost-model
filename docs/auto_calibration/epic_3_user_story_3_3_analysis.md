# Epic 3 User Story 3.3: Analyze Tuning Results

## Executive Summary

Based on the 200-iteration auto-tuning campaign results (best score: 0.1553), we have identified key trade-offs the tuner made and specific areas for refinement. This analysis provides actionable recommendations for improving calibration in the next campaign.

## Campaign 1 Results Analysis

### Best Configuration Performance (Score: 0.1553)

**Headcount Growth**: 0.0% vs 3.0% target → **MAJOR MISS** (-3.0pp error)
**Pay Growth**: 5.3% vs 3.0% target → **OVERSHOOT** (+2.3pp error)

**Age Distribution**:
- `<30`: 3.5% vs 10.9% target → **MAJOR MISS** (-7.4pp error)
- `30-39`: 34.2% vs 21.0% target → **MAJOR MISS** (+13.2pp error)  
- `40-49`: 22.8% vs 33.6% target → **MISS** (-10.8pp error)
- `50-59`: 24.6% vs 21.0% target → **OK** (+3.6pp error)
- `60-65`: 4.4% vs 5.0% target → **OK** (-0.6pp error)
- `65+`: 10.5% vs 8.4% target → **OK** (+2.1pp error)

**Tenure Distribution**:
- `<1`: 45.0% vs 20.0% target → **MAJOR MISS** (+25.0pp error)
- `1-3`: 22.5% vs 30.0% target → **MISS** (-7.5pp error)
- `3-5`: 12.6% vs 25.0% target → **MAJOR MISS** (-12.4pp error)
- `5-10`: Similar pattern of depletion in experienced bands

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Headcount Growth Failure (0% vs 3% target)
**Issue**: Despite `target_growth: 0.01` in best config, actual growth was 0%
**Root Causes**:
- New hire rate insufficient to offset terminations
- High termination rates across all tenure bands
- Possible parameter conflicts between growth targets and attrition rates

### 2. Tenure Imbalance (45% <1yr vs 20% target)
**Issue**: Excessive new hire churn creating unstable workforce
**Root Causes**:
- `new_hire_termination_rate: 0.2` still too high
- Insufficient protection for new employees in first year
- Termination age/tenure multipliers not providing adequate protection

### 3. Age Distribution Skew
**Issue**: Losing young workforce, accumulating 30-39 age band
**Root Causes**:
- Young employee termination rates too high despite age multipliers
- New hire age profile not young enough to maintain <30 representation
- Insufficient young employee retention mechanisms

### 4. Pay Growth Overshoot (5.3% vs 3% target)
**Issue**: Compensation increases exceeding budget targets
**Root Causes**:
- `annual_compensation_increase_rate: 0.035` + `merit_base: 0.035` + COLA ~1.4% = cumulative overshoot
- Multiple compensation mechanisms compounding

## Implemented Refinements

### 1. Score Weight Rebalancing
**Previous**: AGE(35%), TENURE(25%), HC_GROWTH(25%), PAY_GROWTH(15%)
**Updated**: AGE(30%), TENURE(30%), HC_GROWTH(30%), PAY_GROWTH(10%)

**Rationale**:
- Increased TENURE weight due to major imbalance (45% vs 20% <1yr)
- Increased HC_GROWTH weight due to complete miss (0% vs 3%)
- Reduced AGE weight to allow flexibility for business targets
- Reduced PAY_GROWTH weight as it's less critical than workforce stability

### 2. Search Space Refinements

#### Growth & Hiring Parameters
- `target_growth`: [0.025, 0.030, 0.035, 0.040, 0.045, 0.050] (focused on 3% target)
- `new_hire_rate`: [0.12, 0.15, 0.18, 0.20, 0.22] (higher minimum for growth)
- `new_hire_average_age`: [25, 27, 28, 30, 32] (younger focus for <30 preservation)

#### Termination Protection
- `base_rate_for_new_hire`: [0.08, 0.10, 0.12, 0.15, 0.18] (lower maximum)
- `tenure_multipliers.<1`: [0.5, 0.6, 0.8] (stronger new hire protection)
- `age_multipliers.<30`: [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5] (stronger young employee protection)

#### Compensation Control
- `annual_compensation_increase_rate`: [0.020, 0.025, 0.028, 0.030, 0.032] (lower maximum)
- `merit_base`: [0.020, 0.025, 0.030, 0.032] (constrained range)
- `cola_hazard.by_year.*`: Reduced all COLA ranges by ~20% to control pay growth

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Campaign 2)
1. **Run 100-200 iteration campaign** with refined weights and search space
2. **Monitor component scores** during tuning to verify weight effectiveness
3. **Validate parameter pathways** with targeted single-parameter tests if needed

### Parameter Sensitivity Testing
Before large campaigns, consider testing:
- New hire rate impact on growth achievement
- Termination multiplier effectiveness for tenure balance
- Compensation parameter interactions

### Success Criteria for Campaign 2
- **Headcount Growth**: Achieve 2.5-3.5% (within 0.5pp of 3% target)
- **Tenure Balance**: Reduce <1yr to 25-30% range (vs current 45%)
- **Age Preservation**: Improve <30 representation to 7-12% range
- **Pay Growth**: Control to 2.5-3.5% range (vs current 5.3% overshoot)

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Campaign 2** with refined configuration
2. **Analyze results** using `analyze_tuning_results.py` script
3. **Iterate weights/ranges** based on Campaign 2 outcomes
4. **Consider production deployment** once targets are consistently achieved
