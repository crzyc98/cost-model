Epic 3: Validate System and Conduct Initial Tuning Campaign

User Story 3.1 (End-to-End Auto-Tuner Test):
As a Model Developer, I want to run the tune_configs.py script for a small number of iterations (e.g., 3-5) after all parsing and scoring enhancements are complete, so that I can verify the entire end-to-end workflow (config generation, simulation execution, full metrics parsing, correct scoring, and results saving) is functioning correctly.

User Story 3.2 (Execute Initial Full Auto-Tuning Campaign):
As a Model Maintainer, I want to execute a comprehensive auto-tuning campaign (e.g., 100-1000 iterations) using the validated tune_configs.py script so that I can generate an empirically optimized baseline configuration for the workforce model.

User Story 3.3 (Analyze and Select Best Tuned Configuration):
As a Model Maintainer, I want to analyze the tuning_results.json and best_config.yaml from the auto-tuning campaign so that I can understand the results, select the most suitable configuration, and establish it as the new production baseline.

## User Story 3.3 Analysis: 200-Iteration Campaign Deep Dive

### Executive Summary

The 200-iteration auto-tuning campaign was operationally successful, generating 200 configurations and identifying an "optimal" configuration with score 0.1553. However, this analysis reveals significant target misses that require strategic adjustments before deploying the configuration as a production baseline.

### Key Findings

#### 1. Score Function Paradox
Despite massive target misses (especially -19.8pp on young workforce and +25.0pp on new hires), the configuration achieved the "best" score of 0.1553. This suggests:
- **Score weights may not reflect business priorities**: Equal 0.25 weights for all components may undervalue critical demographic targets
- **KL divergence may be dominated by large errors**: The scoring function may not adequately penalize extreme misses in key demographics

#### 2. Identical Outcomes Pattern
Analysis revealed 9 configurations with identical scores, suggesting:
- **Parameter boundary conditions**: The simulation may be hitting constraints that prevent further optimization
- **Search space limitations**: Current parameter ranges may not enable the demographic shifts needed
- **Model structural limitations**: The underlying simulation logic may have inherent constraints

#### 3. Critical Parameter Analysis

**Best Configuration Key Parameters:**
- `target_growth: 0.01` (1%) - Yet achieved 0% growth
- `new_hire_rate: 0.06` (6%) - Fixed across configurations
- `termination_hazard.base_rate_for_new_hire: 0.2` (20%)
- `termination_hazard.age_multipliers.<30: 0.6` (40% reduction for young employees)
- `promotion_hazard.age_multipliers.<30: 1.6` (60% boost for young promotions)

#### 4. Root Cause Hypotheses

**Zero Headcount Growth Despite 1% Target:**
- High new hire termination (20%) may offset hiring efforts
- Experienced employee attrition may exceed new hire retention
- The interplay between `target_growth`, `new_hire_rate`, and termination rates creates equilibrium at 0%

**Young Workforce Shortage (5.2% vs 25% target):**
- `new_hire_average_age: 30` may be too high for building <30 demographic
- Even with 0.6x termination multiplier for <30, insufficient young hiring
- New hire termination rate (20%) prevents young employees from establishing tenure

**Excessive New Hire Churn (45% vs 20% target):**
- 20% new hire termination rate is still too high
- Rapid churn prevents tenure progression from <1 to 1-3 years
- Creates perpetual "new hire treadmill" effect

**Retiree Accumulation (8.6% vs 0% target):**
- `max_working_age: 65` not being strictly enforced
- `termination_hazard.age_multipliers.60-65: 2.0` insufficient for clearing pre-retirees
- May need forced retirement logic or higher termination multipliers

### Strategic Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (Pre-Production Deployment)

1. **Validate with Production Census**: Run best_config.yaml with actual company census data to verify performance patterns
2. **Manual Parameter Verification**: Test specific parameter pathways to confirm they influence simulation outcomes
3. **Document Current State**: Establish this as "Iteration 1 Baseline" rather than production-ready configuration

#### Next Tuning Campaign Adjustments

1. **Revise Score Weights**:
   ```yaml
   WEIGHT_AGE = 0.40          # Increase from 0.25 (young workforce critical)
   WEIGHT_TENURE = 0.30       # Increase from 0.25 (new hire churn critical)
   WEIGHT_HC_GROWTH = 0.20    # Reduce from 0.25
   WEIGHT_PAY_GROWTH = 0.10   # Reduce from 0.25
   ```

2. **Expand Search Space**:
   ```yaml
   "global_parameters.new_hires.new_hire_rate": [0.08, 0.10, 0.12, 0.15]  # Higher hiring
   "global_parameters.termination_hazard.base_rate_for_new_hire": [0.10, 0.15, 0.18]  # Lower churn
   "global_parameters.new_hire_average_age": [25, 27, 28]  # Younger hires
   "global_parameters.max_working_age": [62, 63, 64]  # Earlier retirement
   ```

3. **Add New Tunable Parameters**:
   - Hiring age distribution controls
   - Forced retirement enforcement
   - Tenure-based hiring profiles

#### Model Enhancement Considerations

1. **Hiring Age Distribution**: Implement controls for new hire age profiles beyond just mean/std
2. **Strict Retirement Enforcement**: Add logic to force termination at max_working_age
3. **Tenure-Based Hiring**: Allow different hiring rates by target tenure bands
4. **Dynamic Headcount Targeting**: Improve the relationship between target_growth and actual hiring/termination decisions

### Detailed Parameter Analysis

#### Search Space Limitations Identified

**Critical Missing Parameters:**
- `new_hire_rate` is **FIXED at 0.06** (not in search space) - This is a major constraint
- `new_hire_average_age` is **FIXED at 30** - Prevents building younger workforce
- `max_working_age` is **FIXED at 65** - No retirement enforcement variation

**Current Search Space Issues:**
```yaml
# These ranges may be insufficient for target achievement:
"termination_hazard.base_rate_for_new_hire": [0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40]  # Min 20% still too high
"termination_hazard.age_multipliers.<30": [0.6, 0.8, 1.0]  # Even 0.6 insufficient
"target_growth": [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05]  # 1% target achieved 0% growth
```

#### Root Cause Analysis: Mathematical Constraints

**Zero Growth Equation:**
```
Net Growth = (new_hire_rate × workforce) - (total_terminations)
0% = (6% × 117) - (experienced_terms + new_hire_terms)
0% = 7.02 new hires - ~7 total terminations
```

The system reaches equilibrium where hiring exactly balances attrition, regardless of `target_growth` parameter.

**Young Workforce Bottleneck:**
```
Young Employees = new_hires_retained × age_filter
5.2% = (6% hiring × 80% retention × 3 years) × (age<30 filter)
```

With `new_hire_average_age: 30`, most new hires start at 30+, making <30 demographic impossible to build.

**New Hire Churn Cycle:**
```
Tenure <1 = annual_new_hires ÷ (1 - new_hire_termination_rate)
45% = 6% ÷ (1 - 20%) = 6% ÷ 80% = 7.5% effective churn rate
```

High churn creates a "treadmill effect" where new hires never progress to established tenure bands.

#### Identical Configurations Analysis

The single best configuration (score 0.1553) suggests the tuner found a unique optimum, but the presence of 2 configurations with infinite scores indicates some parameter combinations cause simulation failures.

**Hypothesis for Convergence:**
- The search space constraints force most viable configurations toward similar parameter values
- The scoring function's equal weights (0.25 each) create a specific optimization landscape
- Model constraints (hiring logic, termination logic) create natural boundaries

### Strategic Recommendations (Revised)

#### Phase 1: Immediate Search Space Expansion

1. **Add Critical Missing Parameters**:
   ```yaml
   # Add to SEARCH_SPACE in tune_configs.py:
   "global_parameters.new_hires.new_hire_rate": [0.08, 0.10, 0.12, 0.15, 0.18]
   "global_parameters.new_hire_average_age": [25, 27, 28, 30]
   "global_parameters.max_working_age": [62, 63, 64, 65]
   ```

2. **Expand Constrained Ranges**:
   ```yaml
   # Lower new hire termination rates:
   "global_parameters.termination_hazard.base_rate_for_new_hire": [0.10, 0.15, 0.18, 0.20, 0.25]

   # Stronger young employee protection:
   "global_parameters.termination_hazard.age_multipliers.<30": [0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8]

   # Higher growth targets:
   "global_parameters.target_growth": [0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08]
   ```

#### Phase 2: Score Function Rebalancing

```python
# Revised weights in tune_configs.py score() function:
WEIGHT_AGE = 0.40          # Critical: young workforce shortage
WEIGHT_TENURE = 0.30       # Critical: new hire retention
WEIGHT_HC_GROWTH = 0.20    # Important: but secondary to demographics
WEIGHT_PAY_GROWTH = 0.10   # Least critical: easier to achieve
```

#### Phase 3: Model Logic Validation

1. **Test Parameter Pathways**: Verify that tuned parameters actually influence simulation outcomes
2. **Boundary Condition Analysis**: Identify hard constraints in the simulation logic
3. **Retirement Enforcement**: Ensure `max_working_age` is strictly enforced

#### Phase 4: Next Campaign Execution

**Recommended Campaign Size**: 300-500 iterations with expanded search space
**Expected Improvements**:
- Young workforce: Target 15-20% (vs current 5.2%)
- New hire retention: Target 25-30% tenure <1 (vs current 45%)
- Headcount growth: Target 2-3% (vs current 0%)

### Conclusion

The auto-tuning system is operationally successful but requires refinement to achieve business-critical demographic targets. The current "best" configuration represents a local optimum within current constraints rather than a globally optimal solution.

**Key Insight**: The primary limitation is not the tuning algorithm but the **search space definition**. Critical parameters like `new_hire_rate` and `new_hire_average_age` were fixed, preventing the system from exploring configurations that could achieve the demographic targets.

The next iteration should focus on:
1. **Expanding the search space** to include previously fixed parameters
2. **Adjusting score weights** to prioritize demographic targets
3. **Validating parameter pathways** to ensure tuned values influence outcomes
4. **Testing boundary conditions** to understand model constraints

This analysis provides a clear roadmap for achieving the target workforce demographics through systematic auto-tuning refinement.
