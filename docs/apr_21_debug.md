no one proactively enrolled

if someone opts out of ae that would mean they opt out of ai

auto annual increase, no one is in it?  if we run a new hire ae program, the people that are in auto enrollment will be annual increased a year after their enrollment date.  if it is all eligilbe, it would be the same but in this case everyone that is a current active would be re-enrolled at the default rate (if they have a rate that is below the default rate but greater than 0.  could we add a way in config to tell you who to re-enroll at the default rate?)

if somoene opts out, the opt out date would be a random date beween the window start and window end

became eligible during year is always false?
