Break project_census (and its sibling functions) into smaller, testable units
• Create methods like apply_comp_increase(), apply_turnover(), generate_new_hires(), run_plan_rules() in projection_utils.py or a new ProjectionEngine class
Extract ML-turnover logic into its own turnover_engine.py with functions like try_load_ml_model() and predict_turnover()
Introduce YAML anchors for scenario inheritance so you can drop all get(..., default) boilerplate
Add timers and vectorize heavy loops with pandas/NumPy
Add type hints throughout and build small pytest suites for each function
(Stretch) Make salary/termination samplers pluggable via strategy classes, flag on proration debug samples, and eventually evolve plan rules into a DSL

Overall, this is a quite comprehensive projection engine—and you’ve clearly wired together population dynamics, ML‐based turnover, and your plan-rule engine in one place. A few high-level thoughts, followed by more targeted suggestions:

⸻

1. Architecture & Organization
	1.	Single Responsibility & Readability
	•	project_census is doing everything—comp increases, ML scoring, rule-based turnover, new hires, plan rules, snap-shots, logging, debug prints. Consider breaking it into smaller functions or even a class with methods like apply_compensation_increase(...), apply_turnover(...), generate_new_hires(...), run_plan_rules(...), etc.  That will make each block easier to test, profile, and maintain.
	2.	Remove sys.path.insert
	•	That hack can lead to confusing import collisions. Instead, mark / as a package root (via setup.py or pyproject.toml) or use a proper source layout (e.g. src/utils/...).
	3.	Facade Layer
	•	Your utils/plan_rules.py facade is a good step; you could do the same within projection_utils.py—e.g. delegate the ML vs rule-based turnover choice to a turnover_engine module, rather than inlining it.

⸻

2. Configuration & Flexibility
	1.	YAML/JSON-driven Parameters
	•	You’re mixing defaults, scenario_config, and hard-coded constants (e.g. DEFAULT_COMP_LOG_MEAN_FACTOR). It might be cleaner to load all of those defaults from a config/defaults.yaml or similar so that analysts can tweak distributions without code changes.
	2.	Scenario Inheritance & Overrides
	•	You already discussed YAML anchors for scenario definitions—once you have that in place, you can drop all of the get('x', default_x) logic and simply merge the user’s override onto your base defaults.

⸻

3. Logging & Debug Output
	1.	Swap print → logger
	•	Everywhere you do print("Warning: …") or print("DEBUG: …"), switch to logger.warning(), logger.debug() or logger.info(). This gives you log levels, timestamps, and the ability to route output to files or dashboards.
	2.	Structured vs. Free-Text
	•	For long-running simulations it’s often valuable to emit JSON logs (e.g. using structlog) so you can easily build dashboards around per-year metrics.
	3.	At-a-Glance Summaries
	•	You already log “Year X summary” near the end. Consider moving that up higher (right after plan rules) so you can grep “Year 2027 summary” without wading through 200 DEBUG lines.

⸻

4. Performance & Profiling
	1.	Use Timers Around Big Blocks
	•	You already capture eligibility/AE/AI/contributions durations—great. You could wrap other heavy steps (ML scoring, new-hire generation) in the same pattern so that you can spot new bottlenecks as your model scales.
	2.	Vectorization
	•	Where possible, push operations into pandas/NumPy (e.g. sampling terminations, compensation draws) rather than Python loops. That will speed up large headcounts.

⸻

5. Testing & Maintainability
	1.	Unit-Testable Components
	•	Splitting out each discrete step into its own function means you can write small pytest modules for e.g. “Given a 10% turnover rate, every 1 in 10 rows get a termination_date in [start,end] range.”
	2.	Type Hints & Mypy
	•	You’ve already added hints in your agent classes—consider adding function signatures to project_census and the plan-rule facades so mypy can help you catch signature mismatches early.
	3.	ML Fallback Logic
	•	The try/except around ML is good, but you could extract that into a helper like try_load_ml_model(...) → Optional[pipeline] and predict_turnover(...) → Series, each with its own tests.

⸻

6. Domain-Specific Enhancements
	1.	Second-Year & Term Salary Distributions
	•	You’ve implemented sampling for second-year and term salaries—nice. Consider making those distributions pluggable (e.g. pass in a SalarySampler object via config) so you can swap in different statistical models later.
	2.	Proration Sampling
	•	You log detailed proration examples today—once you’re happy with the math, you could turn those into an optional “debug sample” behind a flag.
	3.	Plan-Rule Decoupling
	•	You already have a rules engine in utils/rules. Eventually you might replace those with a DSL (JSON/YAML formulas) so that non-engineers can tweak match tiers or eligibility thresholds without touching Python.

⸻

In Summary
	•	Break project_census into smaller, testable pieces.
	•	Switch all print()s to logger calls (with levels!).
	•	Centralize defaults in a config file rather than constants.
	•	Push more work into pandas/NumPy for speed.
	•	Add type hints and unit tests around each logical component.

Implementing those changes will make your sandbox code even more robust, far easier for analysts to extend, and simpler to migrate into a production service (or web UI) down the road. Great work so far—these tweaks will take it to the next level!
