# Auto-Tuning Campaign 2 - Ready to Execute

## Epic 3 User Story 3.3 Analysis Complete ✅

Based on the comprehensive analysis of Campaign 1 results (best score: 0.1553), we have implemented strategic refinements to address the key issues:

### Key Issues Addressed
- **Headcount Growth Miss**: 0% vs 3% target → Increased HC_GROWTH weight to 30%, higher new_hire_rate ranges
- **Tenure Imbalance**: 45% <1yr vs 20% target → Increased TENURE weight to 30%, stronger new hire protection
- **Age Distribution Skew**: <30 at 3.5% vs 10.9% target → Younger new hire focus, stronger young employee protection
- **Pay Growth Overshoot**: 5.3% vs 3% target → Constrained compensation parameter ranges

## Campaign 2 Execution Commands

### 1. Run Refined Tuning Campaign (100-200 iterations recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/nicholasamaral/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Development/cost-model

# Run Campaign 2 with refined parameters
python tuning/tune_configs.py --iterations 100 --output-dir campaign_2_results

# For more comprehensive search (if time permits)
python tuning/tune_configs.py --iterations 200 --output-dir campaign_2_results
```

### 2. Analyze Campaign 2 Results

```bash
# Analyze results with detailed breakdown
python tuning/analyze_tuning_results.py --results-file campaign_2_results/tuning_results.json

# Compare with Campaign 1 if available
python tuning/analyze_tuning_results.py --results-file test_tuning/tuning_results.json
```

### 3. Validate Best Configuration

```bash
# Test best configuration with full simulation
python scripts/run_simulation.py \
  --config campaign_2_results/best_config.yaml \
  --scenario baseline \
  --census data/census_template.parquet \
  --output campaign_2_validation/

# Check validation results
ls -la campaign_2_validation/Baseline/
```

## Expected Improvements in Campaign 2

### Success Criteria
- **Headcount Growth**: Achieve 2.5-3.5% (within 0.5pp of 3% target)
- **Tenure Balance**: Reduce <1yr to 25-30% range (vs Campaign 1's 45%)
- **Age Preservation**: Improve <30 representation to 7-12% range (vs Campaign 1's 3.5%)
- **Pay Growth**: Control to 2.5-3.5% range (vs Campaign 1's 5.3% overshoot)

### Score Improvement Target
- **Campaign 1 Best**: 0.1553
- **Campaign 2 Target**: <0.10 (significant improvement expected)

## Monitoring During Campaign

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Component Score Balance**: Ensure no single component dominates
2. **Parameter Convergence**: Look for consistent parameter patterns in top performers
3. **Distribution Quality**: Verify age/tenure distributions are being extracted correctly

### Early Stopping Criteria
If after 50 iterations the best score hasn't improved below 0.12, consider:
- Further weight adjustments
- Search space refinements
- Parameter interaction analysis

## Post-Campaign Analysis

### If Campaign 2 Succeeds (Score <0.10)
1. Deploy best configuration for production use
2. Document successful parameter combinations
3. Consider fine-tuning campaign for marginal improvements

### If Campaign 2 Needs Iteration (Score >0.10)
1. Analyze which error components are still problematic
2. Adjust weights further based on results
3. Consider targeted parameter testing
4. Run Campaign 3 with additional refinements

## Files Modified for Campaign 2

- `tuning/tune_configs.py`: Updated score weights (30/30/30/10) and refined search space
- `tuning/analyze_tuning_results.py`: Created comprehensive analysis tool
- `docs/auto_calibration/epic_3_user_story_3_3_analysis.md`: Detailed analysis documentation
- `tuning/campaign_2_instructions.md`: This execution guide

## Backup and Recovery

### Before Running Campaign 2
```bash
# Backup current results
cp -r test_tuning/ campaign_1_backup/
cp tuning/tune_configs.py tuning/tune_configs_campaign_1.py.bak
```

### Rollback if Needed
```bash
# Restore Campaign 1 configuration
cp tuning/tune_configs_campaign_1.py.bak tuning/tune_configs.py
```
