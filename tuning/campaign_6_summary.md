## Launch Instructions

### Recommended Campaign 6 Execution
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/cost-model

# Launch Campaign 6 with 100-200 iterations
python tuning/tune_configs.py --iterations 150 --output-dir campaign_6_results

# For quick validation (50 iterations)
python tuning/tune_configs.py --iterations 50 --output-dir campaign_6_validation
```

### Expected Runtime
- **50 iterations**: ~2-3 hours
- **150 iterations**: ~6-8 hours
- **200 iterations**: ~8-12 hours

## Analysis Framework

### Post-Campaign Analysis
1. **Score Distribution**: Analyze best scores vs Campaign 5 baseline
2. **Headcount Growth**: Focus on positive growth achievement
3. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Identify which aggressive parameters drive success
4. **Trade-off Analysis**: Understand impacts on age/tenure distributions

### Success Indicators
- **Best Score Improvement**: Target < 0.08 overall score
- **Positive HC Growth**: Any configuration achieving > +1.0% growth
- **Balanced Performance**: Maintain age/tenure/pay calibration

## Contingency Planning

### If Campaign 6 Fails to Achieve Positive Growth
**Model Logic Investigation Required**:
1. Analyze how target_growth translates to hires_to_make
2. Examine overall termination/hire balance in simulation engine
3. Consider implementing maintain_headcount: true logic
4. Investigate potential structural model limitations

### Next Steps Based on Results
- **Success**: Refine best configuration for production deployment
- **Partial Success**: Campaign 7 with targeted parameter adjustments
- **Failure**: Deep model logic investigation and structural changes

## Key Differences from Campaign 5

| Aspect | Campaign 5 | Campaign 6 | Change |
|--------|------------|------------|---------|
| target_growth | [0.035-0.045] | [0.050-0.070] | +40% higher |
| new_hire_rate | [0.20-0.40] | [0.40-0.60] | +50% higher |
| base_rate_for_new_hire | [0.05-0.10] | [0.03-0.05] | 40% lower |
| tenure_multipliers.<1 | [0.2-0.5] | [0.1-0.3] | 50% lower |
| HC_GROWTH weight | 0.50 | 0.60 | +20% priority |
| Total parameters | 39 | 43 | +4 parameters |

This aggressive approach represents the most focused attempt yet to achieve positive headcount growth while maintaining the excellent calibration progress from previous campaigns.
