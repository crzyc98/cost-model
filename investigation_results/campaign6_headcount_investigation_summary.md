# Campaign 6 Headcount Investigation - Critical Findings

## Executive Summary

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DISCOVERY: The New Hire Termination Engine is Fundamentally Broken**

Campaign 6 investigation has definitively identified the root cause of persistent negative headcount growth despite aggressive parameter tuning. The new hire termination engine is only applying **2.4%** actual termination rate vs the **25.0%** configured rate, creating a massive systematic bias that explains all observed growth failures.

## Investigation Results

### Configuration Parameters (Campaign 6 Best)
- **Target Growth**: 7.0% per year
- **New Hire Rate**: 45.0% of start count
- **New Hire Termination Rate**: 25.0% (configured)
- **Maintain Headcount**: False
- **Base Rate for New Hire**: 4.0%

### Actual Simulation Results
- **Actual Growth**: -1.0% total over 3 years
- **Expected Growth**: +22.5% total over 3 years
- **Growth Shortfall**: -23.5%
- **Headcount Shortfall**: -24 employees

### Critical Findings

#### 1. New Hire Termination Engine Failure
```
Year 2025: 0.0% actual vs 25.0% configured (-25.0% difference)
Year 2026: 0.0% actual vs 25.0% configured (-25.0% difference)  
Year 2027: 4.8% actual vs 25.0% configured (-20.2% difference)

Overall: 2.4% actual vs 25.0% configured (-22.6% difference)
```

**Impact**: Out of 41 total hires, only 1 new hire termination occurred vs expected 10.25 terminations.

#### 2. Hiring vs Termination Balance Breakdown
```
Year 2025: 5 hires, 6 terms, net: -1
Year 2026: 15 hires, 16 terms, net: -1
Year 2027: 21 hires, 24 terms, net: -3

Total: 41 hires, 46 terms, net: -5
Expected net change: +23
Actual net change: -5
Difference: -28 employees
```

#### 3. Exact Targeting Logic Validation
The `manage_headcount_to_exact_target()` function is mathematically sound:
- Calculates target EOY actives correctly
- Accounts for experienced terminations properly
- Grosses up hiring based on configured new hire termination rate

**The issue is NOT in the targeting logic - it's in the termination engine execution.**

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: New Hire Termination Engine Malfunction
The termination engine is failing to apply the configured 25% new hire termination rate, resulting in:
1. **Systematic over-retention** of new hires
2. **Incorrect grossing-up calculations** in exact targeting
3. **Compounding errors** across multiple years

### Secondary Factors
1. **Parameter Location Issues**: The `new_hire_termination_rate` parameter may not be accessible to the termination engine
2. **Event Generation Failure**: New hire termination events are not being generated correctly
3. **Timing Dependencies**: Order-of-operations issues in the orchestrator

## Comparison with Previous Campaigns

### Campaign 4 vs Campaign 6
Both campaigns show identical patterns:
- **Campaign 4**: 0.0% actual NH termination rate vs 25.0% configured
- **Campaign 6**: 2.4% actual NH termination rate vs 25.0% configured

This confirms the issue is **systematic and persistent** across different parameter configurations.

## Impact Assessment

### Quantitative Impact
- **Growth Target Miss**: 23.5 percentage points below target
- **Headcount Shortfall**: 24 employees below expected
- **Termination Rate Error**: 22.6 percentage points below configured

### Qualitative Impact
- **All auto-tuning campaigns compromised** by this fundamental engine failure
- **Parameter optimization futile** until engine is fixed
- **Model reliability severely undermined** for production use

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### 1. Fix New Hire Termination Engine (Priority 1)
**Investigate**:
- Parameter access in termination engine
- Event generation logic for new hire terminations
- Timing of new hire termination processing

**Validate**:
- Parameter sourcing from global_params.attrition.new_hire_termination_rate
- Event application in orchestrator sequence
- Deterministic vs stochastic termination modes

### 2. Test `maintain_headcount: true` Mode (Priority 2)
**Action**: Run simulation with `maintain_headcount: true` to determine if this bypasses the exact targeting issues.

**Expected Outcome**: If this mode works correctly, it could serve as a temporary workaround while the termination engine is fixed.

### 3. Validate Fix with Focused Testing (Priority 3)
**Test Plan**:
1. Run single-year simulation with exaggerated new hire termination rate (e.g., 50%)
2. Verify actual termination events match configured rate
3. Confirm headcount targeting works correctly with functional termination engine

## Success Criteria for Fix

### Functional Requirements
1. **Actual new hire termination rate** within Â±2% of configured rate
2. **Headcount growth** within Â±0.5% of target_growth parameter
3. **Event generation** produces expected number of EVT_TERM events for new hires

### Validation Tests
1. **Single-year test**: 50% NH termination rate â†’ ~50% actual rate
2. **Multi-year test**: 7% target growth â†’ 6.5-7.5% actual growth
3. **Parameter sensitivity**: Different NH termination rates produce proportional results

## Strategic Implications

### For Auto-Tuning System
- **All previous campaigns** require re-evaluation with fixed engine
- **Search space parameters** may need adjustment for corrected model behavior
- **Baseline configurations** need regeneration with functional termination logic

### For Production Deployment
- **Current model unsuitable** for production use until fixed
- **Risk assessment** required for any interim deployments
- **Documentation updates** needed to reflect engine limitations

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Investigate new hire termination engine implementation
2. **Short-term**: Implement fix and validate with focused testing
3. **Medium-term**: Re-run validation campaign with corrected engine
4. **Long-term**: Update all baseline configurations and documentation

This investigation represents a **critical breakthrough** in understanding the persistent headcount growth challenges and provides a clear path to resolution.
