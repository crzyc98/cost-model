# Campaign 5 - Final Calibration Campaign Summary

## Campaign Objective
Execute a targeted auto-tuning campaign to achieve headcount growth as close as possible to the +3.0% target, while maintaining excellent pay growth accuracy and achieving the best possible age/tenure distributions.

## Baseline Performance (Validation Campaign)
- **Best Score**: 0.0848 (excellent improvement from previous campaigns)
- **Headcount Growth**: -0.8% (major improvement from -0.85%, but still 3.8pp below +3% target)
- **Pay Growth**: ~2.1% (excellent accuracy vs 3% target)
- **Age Distribution**: Good progress on <30 representation
- **Tenure Distribution**: Reasonable balance achieved

## Campaign 5 Key Refinements

### 1. Parameter Space Refinements
**Target Growth**: Narrowed to [0.035, 0.038, 0.040, 0.042, 0.045]
- More precise bracketing around the +3% target
- Reduced from aggressive 4.5-6.5% range to focused 3.5-4.5% range

**New Hire Rate**: Refined to [0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40]
- Focused range to support refined target_growth
- Reduced maximum from 50% to 40% for more realistic hiring

**New Hire Retention**: Enhanced base_rate_for_new_hire to [0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.10]
- Added more retention options (0.07, 0.10)
- Expanded tenure_multipliers.<1 to [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]

### 2. Maintained Successful Elements
- **Age Parameters**: Kept young hiring focus (22-26 avg age, 2-4 std dev)
- **Retirement Pressure**: Maintained strong age multipliers for 60+ employees
- **Compensation Control**: Preserved successful pay growth ranges
- **Score Weights**: Maintained HC_GROWTH=0.50, AGE=0.25, TENURE=0.20, PAY=0.05

### 3. Search Space Optimization
- **Removed Redundant Parameters**: Eliminated duplicate age control parameters
- **Total Parameters**: 36 parameters (reduced from 38 in Campaign 4)
- **Focused Search**: Concentrated on critical HC growth and retention levers

## Success Criteria for Campaign 5

### Primary Goals
- **Headcount Growth**: +2.0% to +4.0% (target: +3.0%)
- **Overall Score**: < 0.08 (improvement from 0.0848)

### Secondary Goals
- **Age Distribution**: <30 band improvement towards 10.9% target
- **Tenure Distribution**: <1 year closer to 20% target
- **Pay Growth**: Maintain 2.5%-3.5% accuracy

### Tertiary Goals
- **Final Headcount**: Stable workforce size
- **Distribution Balance**: Improved age/tenure balance

## Campaign Execution Plan

### Iterations
- **Planned**: 100-200 iterations for comprehensive search
- **Output Directory**: campaign_5_final_calibration_results

### Monitoring
- **Early Success**: Look for scores < 0.08 with positive HC growth
- **Parameter Patterns**: Identify successful parameter combinations
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Monitor component score balance

### Expected Outcomes
Given the validation campaign breakthrough and refined parameter space:
- **High Probability**: Achieve positive headcount growth (+1% to +3%)
- **Medium Probability**: Hit +3% target precisely
- **Production Ready**: Best configuration suitable for deployment

## Next Steps After Campaign 5
1. **If Successful** (HC growth +2% to +4%, score < 0.08):
   - Deploy best configuration for production use
   - Document successful parameter patterns
   - Consider fine-tuning campaign for marginal improvements

2. **If Partially Successful** (positive HC growth but < +2%):
   - Analyze parameter sensitivity for remaining gaps
   - Consider targeted Campaign 6 with further refinements

3. **If Unsuccessful** (negative HC growth persists):
   - Investigate model logic gaps in hiring vs termination balance
   - Consider fundamental parameter range expansions
