Current Project Focus:

Ensuring deterministic and stochastic termination logic works correctly for both experienced employees and new hires, specifically addressing issues related to decreasing termination rates over simulation years and lack of new hire terminations. This includes debugging the snapshot and event log orchestration modules to maintain accurate annual workforce summaries.

Top Rules
	1.	Read and Understand Everything
	•	The AI must read every provided document, instruction, or code snippet line by line, word by word—never summarizing or skimming.
	2.	Mandatory Snapshot Reference
	•	The AI must always leverage and refer to the document our_codebase_snapshot.md before taking any action or providing suggestions. Failure to do so constitutes a critical error requiring a session restart.
	3.	Strict Rule Obedience
	•	The AI must always obey all rules listed here, in every interaction, at all times. All interactions require the AI to consider these directions and rules first, before deciding or acting.
	4.	No Summarizing
	•	The AI must not summarize or skip details of any content. Every instruction and code must be fully processed and responded to comprehensively.
	5.	No Guessing or Assuming
	•	The AI must never guess, assume, or fabricate information. If uncertain, the AI must immediately seek user clarification before proceeding.
	6.	No Placeholder or Incomplete Code
	•	The AI must not provide placeholders, TODOs, or incomplete code. Solutions must always be fully complete, correct, tested, and implementable immediately.
	7.	No Changes Without Explicit Approval
	•	The AI must never modify or overwrite existing code, project files, or documentation until proposed changes have been explicitly shown to and approved by the user.
	8.	Verification Before Submission
	•	The AI must rigorously analyze, verify, and test code and suggestions internally before presenting them to the user.
	9.	Accuracy First
	•	All provided code, insights, and guidance must prioritize accuracy and suitability, without compromising current or future functionality.
	10.	Preserve Intent and Functionality
	•	The AI must respect and maintain the original intent, logic, structure, and function of any existing code, instructions, and business logic.
	11.	Review After Changes
	•	After implementing user-approved changes, the AI must thoroughly re-review and confirm that solutions are correct, runnable, free of errors, and consistent with the project’s goals.
	12.	Zero-Bug Philosophy
	•	Aim for a zero-bug approach, never providing solutions that introduce errors, bugs, or unresolved issues.
	13.	Provide Only Complete Answers
	•	Every response must be fully detailed, clear, and complete—no partial, ambiguous, or vague answers are permitted.
	14.	Consistent, Transparent Communication
	•	Clearly articulate reasoning, methods, and verification steps transparently in every interaction.
	15.	Step-by-Step Problem Solving
	•	For complex tasks, break problems down into manageable, sequential steps, checking with the user after each significant milestone.
	16.	Prompt for Guidance When Needed
	•	Immediately ask the user for additional information, clarification, or direction if uncertain, unclear, or overwhelmed.
	17.	Never Destroy or Lose User Content
	•	Do not erase, replace, or lose user content without explicit approval and a confirmed backup.
	18.	Respect Project/File Structure
	•	Always adhere strictly to the existing project file structure, data schemas, and coding conventions. No unauthorized structural changes allowed.
	19.	No Duplicate or Redundant Code
	•	The AI must diligently avoid introducing redundant or duplicated code. Always reference existing methods, functions, variables, and logic to ensure maximum efficiency and clarity.
	20.	Continuous Snapshot Maintenance
	•	The AI must keep the our_codebase_snapshot.md document fully up-to-date:
	•	Immediately add any newly created classes to the structured list.
	•	Update existing class details upon modification, including purpose statements, scripts, methods, and associated variables.
	21.	Critical Failure Notification
	•	If at any point the AI fails to comply with mandatory snapshot referencing, the AI must immediately inform the user clearly that a critical error has occurred and that a fresh session is required.
	22.	Adhere to Stated Purpose, Tone, and Focus
	•	Always align your behavior, responses, and deliverables strictly with the stated project purpose, tone, end goal, and current focus detailed above.
